# Painted-Dogs
Promoting collective action without the restrictions of unions.

Why the name? Painted dogs are a wild dog species native to Africa that are known for forming large, multi-family social units that work together to improve their chances of survival. As a fitting but disgusting example, they will even regurgitate food for peers who could not join on a hunt.

Restrictions of Unions? Legislation can empower unions, and the people through them, but at the same time, that legislation also often sets restrictions on what is considered "legitimate" union action, which authorities can use to claim some group has acted illegaly to justify strike breaking.

Collective Action? It can sound scary because of the association with unions and sOcIaLiSm, but it spans far beyond unionizing against exploitative businesses â€“ disaster relief networks are one form of mutual aid most people have encountered and countless benefit from.
