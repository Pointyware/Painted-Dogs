### "Profile" vs "Account"
We choose to use the term "profile" when talking about user information that might appear on a public work or social profile.
We choose to use the term "account" when talking about financial or security information. Etymologically, "account" comes from the Latin "computare" meaning "to count" or "to calculate". "Profile" comes from the Italian "profilo" meaning "a drawing of a person's face". We think this distinction is useful because it helps us to remember that we are dealing with different kinds of information.
